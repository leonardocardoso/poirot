## Rich Conversation View
Full conversation timeline with user messages, assistant responses, and collapsible tool blocks. Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting, because raw JSONL is not fun to read.

## Tool Block Display
Every tool invocation — Read, Edit, Bash, Write — rendered with its name, icon, file path, and result. Collapsible, copyable, and with smart truncation for long outputs.

## MCP Servers
See all configured Model Context Protocol servers with their connection details, tool counts, and scope badges. Quickly check which servers are available globally vs. per-project. Each server displays a live connection status indicator — Connected, Needs Auth, Failed, Unreachable, Starting, or Unknown — with color-coded SF Symbols and animated effects. Status updates automatically by watching the config and auth cache files.

## Plans

## Debug Log Viewer
Diagnose MCP server issues, permission failures, and startup problems with the per-session debug log viewer. Accessible from the session toolbar, it parses `~/.claude/debug/<sessionId>.txt` files with color-coded log levels (DEBUG in gray, WARN in amber, ERROR in red), full-text search, level filtering, and auto-scroll to the first error. Logs are lazily loaded with paginated fetching for smooth performance on large files. Toggle between absolute and relative timestamps, and copy the full log for sharing in bug reports. Searchable via the universal search overlay.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/showcase/21-debug-log.png" alt="Debug Log Viewer" width="720" />
</p>

---

## Prompt History
Browse your entire Claude Code input history from `~/.claude/history.jsonl`. Prompts are grouped by date (Today, Yesterday, This Week, etc.), filterable by project, and searchable with full-text fuzzy matching. Copy any prompt to clipboard for reuse. Live file watching keeps the view up to date.

## AI Session Summaries
See AI-generated session analysis at the top of each session detail. A collapsible card shows the brief summary, underlying goal, outcome badge, helpfulness rating, session type, goal categories as tags, and friction indicators — all parsed from `~/.claude/usage-data/facets/`. Facets are also searchable via the universal search overlay.
