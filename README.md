## The Story

Poirot was **vibe-coded in a weekend**. The entire app — architecture, parser, UI, tests — was built in a single creative burst with Claude Code as the co-pilot. What started as "I wonder if I can build a companion app for Claude Code... using Claude Code" turned into a real, usable tool.

Named after **Hercule Poirot**, Agatha Christie's legendary detective. Because every great investigation needs the right tools — and Poirot helps you investigate exactly what your AI assistant has been up to.

---

## Getting Started

### Install with Homebrew

```bash
brew tap leonardocardoso/poirot
brew install --cask poirot
```

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| macOS | 15.0+ | — |
| Xcode | 16.0+ | Mac App Store |

Install SwiftLint and SwiftFormat via Homebrew: `brew install swiftlint swiftformat`.

### Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeonardoCardoso/Poirot.git
cd Poirot
brew install swiftlint swiftformat
open Poirot.xcodeproj
```

Hit **&#x2318;R** in Xcode and you're up. Or build from the command line:

```bash
xcodebuild -scheme Poirot -destination 'platform=macOS' -skipMacroValidation build
```

### Run Tests

```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme Poirot -destination 'platform=macOS' -skipMacroValidation
```

Tests use [Swift Testing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/) (`@Test`, `#expect`, `#require`) — not XCTest.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Language | Swift 6 with strict concurrency |
| UI | SwiftUI + Observation (`@Observable`) |
| Concurrency | `MainActor` default isolation |
| DI | Protocol-driven services via `EnvironmentValues` |
| Markdown | [MarkdownUI](https://github.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui) |
| Syntax Highlighting | [HighlightSwift](https://github.com/nicklawls/HighlightSwift) |
| Linting | SwiftLint (strict profile) |
| Formatting | SwiftFormat |
| Testing | Swift Testing with hand-written mocks |

### Design System

Poirot uses a custom dark theme built around a warm golden accent (`#E8A642`) on near-black backgrounds (`#0D0D0F`). All icons are **SF Symbols** with symbol effects (bounce, pulse, replace transitions). Typography scales dynamically with user preference (&#x2318;+/&#x2318;-).

Design tokens live in [`PoirotTheme.swift`](Poirot/Sources/Theme/PoirotTheme.swift) — colors, spacing, radii, and typography all in one place.

### How It Works

```
~/.claude/projects/          Poirot reads JSONL transcripts
        │                    from Claude Code's local storage
        ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  SessionLoader   │──▶ Discovers projects & session files
└────────┬────────┘
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ TranscriptParser │──▶ Parses JSONL into Session/Message models
└────────┬────────┘
         ▼

└────────┬────────┘
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   SwiftUI Views  │──▶ Sidebar → Session Detail → Tool Blocks
└─────────────────┘
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all sizes — bug fixes, new features, documentation, or just fixing a typo.

### Quick Start

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes with tests
4. Ensure the build passes with zero warnings
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Ensure SwiftLint passes
7. Open a PR against `main`

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide on code style, architecture conventions, and testing expectations.

### Code Style at a Glance

- **Swift 6** — All types are implicitly `@MainActor` (no manual annotations needed)
- **`@Observable`** with `@State` — not `ObservableObject`
- **SF Symbols only** — No custom icon assets
- **Swift Testing** — `@Test`, `#expect`, `#require` for all new tests
- **Hand-written mocks** — In `PoirotTests/Mocks/`, no mocking frameworks
